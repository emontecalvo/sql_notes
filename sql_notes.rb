# SQL NOTES: (taken from the book Learning SQL)

# SELECT - the select clause determines which of all possible columns 
# should be included in the queryâ€™s result set

# VIEW - a view is a query that is stored in the data dictionary. 
# It looks and acts like a table, but there is no data associated 
# with a view (think of it as a virtual table).

# WHERE - the where clause is the mechanism for filtering out unwanted 
# rows from your result set, it contain a single filter condition



# ORDER - the order by clause is the mechanism for sorting your result 
# set using either raw column data or expressions based on column data
